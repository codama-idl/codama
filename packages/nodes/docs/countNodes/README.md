# `CountNode` (abstract)

The `CountNode` type helper represents all available strategies that determine the size of a collection. Note that `CountNode` is a type alias and cannot be used directly as a node. Instead you may use one of the following nodes:

-   [`FixedCountNode`](./FixedCountNode.md)
-   [`PrefixedCountNode`](./PrefixedCountNode.md)
-   [`RemainderCountNode`](./RemainderCountNode.md)
